# From environmental moisture to precipitation intensity 
The scripts in this repository look at relationships of environmental moisture, instability (convecitve available potential energy or CAPE), and precipitation intensity in both observation-based product (ERA-Interim and ERA-5 reanalyses) and an idealized model (radiative convective equilibrium simulation).

*RCEchannel_CAPE.m* - Visualize CAPE in the RCE channel as well as its difference from the mean, clustering component also
